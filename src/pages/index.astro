    description:
      "Prioritizing scoring and control, this robot featured an almost 20 block storage capacity that it used to quickly fill long goals, both in skills and head-to-head matches. With a pneumatic hood to quickly switch between scoring and storing and multiple, separately powered rollers, the robot was also capable of sorting its blocks and scoring exclusively one color. Furthermore, the deployable hood roller ensured that the robot had strong block pushing power. Although scoring and storing were its main capabilities, this robot also featured a de-scoring wing that found success and frequent use in head-to-head matches, pushing opposing robots blocks out of goals. To acquire even more blocks to store than those starting on the field, an innovative standoff-plastic match loader could effectively extract blocks in any orientation from the match loader.",

    name: "Hybrid S-Shaped Robot",
    description:
      "Focusing on skills more than head-to-head matches, this robot combines the design principles of standard S-shaped robots with those of a C-shaped robot. For faster-scoring autonomous routines, this robot makes use of front-to-front scoring for both levels of the middle goal and front-to-back scoring for the long goals, and this configuration reduces the amount of rotating that the robot does during its routines, saving valuable time. Uniquely, the method by which this is achieved is through separately-powered rollers, saving air for de-scoring mechanisms and creating the need for a unique ratcheting mechanism. Based on issues from our previous tournament, this robot iterated on our unique match loaded, added a hood for descoring, and featured a second wing. Although harder to engineer, this robot provided our team with valuable experience with string routing and working with polycarbonate, which will greatly benefit us in the future. ",
